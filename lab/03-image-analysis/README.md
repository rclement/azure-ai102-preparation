- [Python Code on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AI-102-AIEngineer/tree/master/05-analyze-text/Python)

## Image Analysis

In order to extract features from images, we will use the Computer Vision SDK.

We will start by selecting the visual features to obtain faces data,
then extract information about age, gender and face rectangle coordinates
from all detected faces.
